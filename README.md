##RenEx

Powerful and sometimes automagical file renaming utility.

Beware, mortal, that you are stepping into realms of black magic! Only strongest arch-mages with years of experience in casting spells in the cryptic language of *Regular Expressions* can fully utilize **RenEx**! If you are not hardened by countless battles with ***bugs***, **RenEx** may as well bring your doom!

But ***seriously***, **RenEx** was never meant to be a *drag-and-done* type of utility. You need in-depth knowledge of Regular Expressions to utilize it to its full potential. Be careful using this software if you don't feel comfortable debugging regular expressions, because if you apply a wrong rule it may mess up your files in a bad way. The software does not provide a way to reverse changes made by it.

**RenEx** is based on **[libWyvernzora](http://github.com/jluchiji/libWyvernzora)**, my personal library. Icons and artwork used in the project are by [Takegawa Shin](http://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=201634).

As of March 29, 2013 the project is still work in progress. It works, but a lot of convenience elements and AI is still missing.

##Dependencies
This project depends on my personal library, **libWyvernzora**. It is updated via my personal NuGet feed, in order to acquire the package please add the following NuGet feed to your VisualStudio:
